# Pal
Command-line chess interface in C++

**P**layers  
**a**re  
**w**inners

A program to play chess on the command line. Right now, it can only interpret full normal moves (beginning square and ending square)
like e2e4, Ng8f6, Bf1c5. It will eventually support fully algebraic notation and be able to detect checkmates.
